            I'm from the Ft. Lauderdale area, but have been living in Kissimmee/Orlando for the last 9 years. My 
            favorite teams are Miami Heat(basketball) and Manchester United(soccer). Star Wars still holds my number 
            1 favorite movie spot, the new ones are a little weird. I have been spending my time during lock down to 
            finally get some exercise workouts in with my new home gym squat rack, and I bought a piano to finally get
            that instrument under my belt. I try to game online, but I keep getting killed quick, so maybe I put in 
            some extra practice on that soon.
